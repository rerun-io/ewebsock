//! A [`WebSocket`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) client library that can be compiled to both native and the web (WASM).
//!
//! Usage:
//! ``` no_run
//! let options = ewebsock::Options::default();
//! let (mut sender, receiver) = ewebsock::connect("ws://example.com", options).unwrap();
//! sender.send(ewebsock::WsMessage::Text("Hello!".into()));
//! while let Some(event) = receiver.try_recv() {
//!     println!("Received {:?}", event);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Feature flags
#![doc = document_features::document_features!()]
//!

#![warn(missing_docs)] // let's keep ewebsock well-documented
